# Veer AI Challenge

To view the website, clone the repo and ensure all the required dependencies are installed by running ```$ npm install``` in the /frontend directory

Run the server using the command in the base directory (/veerai_application):
```
$ python manage.py runserver
``` 
or
```
$ py manage.py runserver
```
if on a windows machine

Once server is running, open a new terminal and run the following commands:
```
$ cd veerai_application/frontend
$ npm start
```

Note that if you are on a windows machine, windows uses backslashes not forward slashes

Video of me using the website just in case it does not run on your local machine can be found here:
